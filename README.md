## Alone Among the Stars

By Takuma Okada | noroadhome.itch.io

A solo roleplaying game about exploring fantastic planets

You are a solitary adventurer, hopping from planet to planet exploring. Each
world has unique features for you to discover and record.

In your ship's log, record a short description and your reaction in a few
sentences, and move on to the next discovery. Each time you complete a planet,
give it a name if it needs one, and find a new planet.
